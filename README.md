# Weather App (8_TheWeather)

8_TheWeather is a user-friendly Java application that provides users with the current weather condition, as well as short-term (24 hours) and long-term (7 days) forecasts for an user-specified location.
<br /><br />
This application retrieves current weather, short-term and long-term forecast data from [OpenWeatherMap's API](http://openweathermap.org/api).
Retreives Mars weather information from [Mars Atmospheric Aggregation System (MAAS)'s API](http://marsweather.ingenology.com/).
The application also uses the [JSON utility](http://www.json.org/java/) to parse the JSON data from OpenWeatherMap and MAAS.
The user interface was designed by hand using Swing and uses a [free icon pack](http://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons/).
